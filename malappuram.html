                    A basin at the base of waterfalls where people can enjoy a dip in the pond is something everyone wants to have an experience. Keralam Kundu Waterfalls are undoubtedly the best of all Malappuram Tourist Places, and that is why people keep flocking here to have an experience of the mystical. 

                    The water flows in from the forest of the western ghat and forms a pool of crystal clear water at the base of the falls. Also, it is believed that the water has many medicinal properties.
