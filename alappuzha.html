                    One of the best places to visit in Alleppey is Kuttanad Backwaters. This isn’t a place, it’s a phenomenon. It is a spectacular lagoon, surrounded by the beauty of lakes, rivers, canals, misty mountains and ethereal landscapes.

                    The experience of floating along the pristine backwaters on a houseboat is inexplicable. You will have to live it to know it! The place is also known as the ‘Rice bowl of Kerala,’ for its stunning rice plantations. If you are in Alleppey for a day, then this place should be your entire itinerary.

                    It is one of the most popular museums in Alleppey. Built-in the 18th century by the king of Travancore, Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, Krishnapuram Palace is quite popular for its vintage architecture and artistic murals.

                    Currently maintained by the Archaeological Department of Kerala, the palace is also home to the biggest mural painting of Kerala-- the 'Gajendra Moksha.’ The enriching mural painting covers an area of about 53 km, making this palace one of the most popular places to visit in Alleppey.

                    Ambalapuzha Temple is one of the most rewarding places to visit in Alleppey. The temple is the oldest Krishna temples in Kerala and among the oldest in India too. The temple has a lovely, soothing ambiance which will calm you down and make you simply want to sit in the temple for hours on the end. Ambalapuzha Temple is also a favorite hangout spot of foreigners. And it deserves all the attention it gets.

                    The inner sanctum is decorated with paintings of Sri Krishna and the other incarnations of Lord Vishnu. A large mandapam outside is a great place to sit and absorb the atmosphere of the temple. Because of its importance in the Vaishnava tradition, the temple is also popularly considered to be the “Dwarka of the South”, which is a great distinction to confer on a place.
