                    The museum is dedicated to Folk art, Tribal art, Traditional art, Anthropology, Architecture, History, Culture, and Heritage of South India. The museum is promoted by Mrs. & Mr George Thaliath and aims to preserve, the culture, heritage and folk art education of Kerala.

                    It is a storehouse of lost pride of the southern part of India which consists of some rare artefacts like Sri Guruvayurappan, watercolour on paper, Lord Brahma and Goddess Saraswathi marriage, oil on canvas, Kindi, a type of a pitcher usually found in old houses and many other precious treasures.
                    
                    62 artists worked on wood for almost 8 years burning the midnight oil to create this temple for artisans. A must visit place for tourists, students, researchers and also for anthropological studies.

                    This beach drawing several tourists is located in a coastal village, located 4km of Pattanakkad. The tall lighthouse in white and red grabs attention as it helps navigate the seamen at night. The Andhakaranazhi Beach happens to be a site for frequent shooting for Malayalam films, thus drawing more attention from the locals.

                    Though seriously affected by the Tsunami in 2004, a brand new bridge and an aerial walkway have been constructed to the sea wall for a magnificent view of a dramatic sunset to cherish for a lifetime.
