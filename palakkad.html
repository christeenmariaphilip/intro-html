                    From the town of Nenmara in Palakkad district, the cloud-caressed peaks of the majestic Nelliyampathy Hill ranges are a sight to behold. The height of the hills ranges from approximately 467 m to 1572 m and it has an extremely calming effect on all who view it. To reach Nelliyampathy, one has to take the road starting from Nenmara that proceeds to the Pothundy Dam. There are about 10 hairpin bends that have to be negotiated on the way to Nelliyampathy.

                    Kava is a beautiful green-land surrounded by mountains all around and its near the Malampuzha dam and is hardly 13km from Palakkad.

We visited Kava on a fine October Sunday. We were well aware of Kava's wonderful sunset view, hence we planned to reach there by evening. Best time to visit Kava is in the evening.

On the way from Palakkad to Kava.. we traveled through forest, with trees having their branches touching ground in such a way that people can climb and swing over them.

                    Malampuzha Dam is the largest dam and reservoir in Kerala, located near Palakkad, in the state of Kerala in South India, built post independence by the then Madras state. Situated in the scenic hills of the Western Ghats in the background it is a combination of a masonry dam with a length of 1,849 metres and an earthen dam with a length of 220 metres making it the longest dam in the state. The dam is 355 feet high and crosses the Malampuzha River, a tributary of Bharathappuzha, Kerala's second longest river. There is a network of two canal systems that serve the dam's reservoir of 42,090 hectares.
